# LangChain TS v1 Learning Plan

This is a suggested learning plan for LangChain with TypeScript.

## Phase 1: Fundamentals

### Week 1: Introduction to LangChain and Core Concepts
*   What is LangChain?
*   Core Components: Models, Prompts, Chains, Indexes
*   Setting up the environment with TypeScript
*   Your first LangChain app: a simple "hello world" with a language model.

### Week 2: Prompts and Models
*   Prompt Templates: creating and using them
*   Few-shot learning with prompts
*   Working with different language models (OpenAI, Hugging Face, etc.)
*   Model I/O: managing inputs and outputs

## Phase 2: Building with Chains and Indexes

### Week 3: Chains
*   Simple chains (e.g., `LLMChain`)
*   Sequential chains
*   Custom chains

### Week 4: Indexes and Retrievers
*   Document Loaders: loading data from various sources
*   Text Splitters: splitting documents for processing
*   Vector Stores: using stores like Chroma and FAISS
*   Retrievers: querying the indexes

## Phase 3: Advanced Topics

### Week 5: Agents and Tools
*   Understanding Agents and their purpose
*   Using built-in tools
*   Creating custom tools

### Week 6: Memory
*   Adding memory to chains and agents
*   Different types of memory

### Week 7: Streaming and Callbacks
*   Streaming responses from language models
*   Using callbacks to monitor and log events

### Week 8: Project Week
*   Build a complete LangChain application (e.g., a question-answering bot over a specific document, a simple agent that can use a few tools).
